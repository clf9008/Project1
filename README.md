# Destination Travel Weather App

## Project Discription

The continually traveling user needs a reliable source to get the most up to date forecast at their destination. This project's motivation was to create a comfortable, user-friendly weather app that can quickly display what the user is looking for. Best for users who are on the go, It allows you to search for any location you are traveling to, and it displays a five-day forecast of the city you searched for. It displays a UV index, humidity, temperature, icon of current weather condition, current time & date, and a live webcam of what your destination's weather looks like. This app can help any user know what to expect when arriving at their destination. What makes our project stand out is the user-friendly features. Also, the live webcam, that displays the weather condition at the destinations.

## Users Story

```
When opening the application, I am presented with a screen that has a search location feature. When I search the destination, the results bring up a page displaying a live webcam of the location. In addition to the live picture, I am presented with the current weather conditions; high’s and low’s for the day, a five-day forecast, humidity %, wind speed, and a UV index. I can then do another search for another destination, and the application will pull up the information for that location. When I am done, I can clear my searches or keep them saved if I would like to view the page again.
